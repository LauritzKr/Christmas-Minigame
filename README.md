# Christmas Minigame

Here is a little collision-based minigame I had to do as a homework! :) 

To execute, click the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP". Extract the ZIP-file and execute main.py inside the master folder.

To change the theme, go to themes/YourTheme and copy and replace all the images into assets.

# Have fun! :D
